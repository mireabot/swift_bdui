# Backend Driven UI for iOS App
In modern mobile application development, delivering dynamic and adaptable user interfaces is crucial to meet evolving user expectations. Traditional approaches often require app updates for UI changes, leading to delays and increased maintenance efforts. Backend-Driven UI (BDUI) offers a solution by shifting UI configuration to the server side, enabling real-time updates without the need for client-side deployments.

This repository delves into the concept of Backend-Driven UI, exploring its advantages, challenges, and implementation strategies in mobile applications. By offloading layout and data handling to the backend, BDUI empowers developers to:

- **Run A/B Tests**: Easily swap or rearrange components to experiment with different designs.
- **Respond Quickly**: Adapt layouts in real-time without requiring app store approval.
- **Simplify Maintenance**: Focus on reusable components while leaving layout decisions to the backend.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Modify the user interface in real-time by updating server configurations, eliminating the need for app store submissions for UI changes.
